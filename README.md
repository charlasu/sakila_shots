Utilizing the public Sakila sample database to practice coding in MySQL.

What's great about Sakila is that there's an opportunity to do lots of different queries because there's a variety of tables.

From practicing joins (my favorite!) and altering the tables to subqueries and creating views, it's all here at your finger tips to mimic real-life situations. Imagine working at a Hollywood studio--you'll need to calculate gross revenue by genre. Or imagine working for a retailer and you want to offer a sale based on Canadian Thanksgiving. Finding information quickly becomes easy with MySQL.
